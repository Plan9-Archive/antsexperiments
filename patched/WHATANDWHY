These are very slightly patched files to help the tools interoperate with the 'rootless' environment. 

the rc simply sets the location of the rcmain initialization file to /boot/rcmain rather than /rc/lib/rcmain.

the factotum adds the -x option, which refuses to mount cs on /net. This is to prevent the loss of the root filesystem from blocking the ability of factotum to auth by causing cs to time out while trying to read from a dead filedescriptor. The -x option should be used in combination with the -a option to speficy a chosen auth server for access to the service namespace.

wranenadb.c modifies wrarena to fix the handling of clump offsets in plan9port. In default plan 9 the bug does not exist and seems related to the new arena number counting logic in the p9p version. In fixing the clump offset handling however I might have broken the arena-offsets, because the origin of the bug seemed to lie in a confusion between those variables in the code. Figuring out what is going on here in detail and checking the behavior of this tool in standard plan 9 is a to-do. Added now the -n option to specificy which arena to use and made it terminate after reading just that number arena. Plan 9 port specific. Investigated the code more and discovered that plan9port seems to diverge from plan9 and the offset trouble may be related. Switched main venti to native plan 9 and now using slightly mofidied nativer wrarena with additional clump info printed.

retired mods were things that seemed necessary or a good idea previously, but I am no longer using.
