These are very slightly patched files to help the tools interoperate with the 'rootless' environment. 

the rc simply sets the location of the rcmain initialization file to /boot/rcmain rather than /rc/lib/rcmain.

the factotum adds the -x option, which refuses to mount cs on /net. This is to prevent the loss of the root filesystem from blocking the ability of factotum to auth by causing cs to time out while trying to read from a dead filedescriptor. The -x option should be used in combination with the -a option to speficy a chosen auth server for access to the service namespace.

wranenadb.c modifies wrarena to fix the handling of clump offsets in plan9port. I haven't tested in default plan 9 to see if the bug is the same. In fixing the clump offset handling however I might have broken the arena-offsets, because the origin of the bug seemed to lie in a confusion between those variables in the code. Figuring out what is going on here in detail and checking the behavior of this tool in standard plan 9 is a to-do. Added now the -n option to specificy which arena to use and made it terminate after reading just that number arena. Plan 9 port specific. Investigated the code more and discovered that plan9port seems to diverge from plan9 and the offset trouble may be related. Tool seems to be working now in p9p as i modded it but I need to test the p9 version with plan9 ventis and see how it behaves.

retired mods were things that seemed necessary or a good idea previously, but I am no longer using.
