<h1><center>Advanced Namespace ToolS for Plan 9</center></h1>
<p>
The Giant ANTS for Plan 9 are a collection of software for making Plan 9 systems more
flexible and reliable by leveraging the power of namespaces.
<p>
The main component is a modified kernel which needs no root fs at boot. It creates an
always available ram/paq rooted namespace accessible by cpu(1) 
from which the user may launch conventional namespaces. 
Additional tools allow the user to reroot quickly to different namespaces 
and create hubs of persistent rc shells shared between all machines on a grid.
<p>
ANTS is compatible with existing x86 Plan 9 installations. The ANTS kernel and tools modify
startup and create new capabilities, but do not change the standard user environment.
You can install the ANTS kernel and tools directly to a fresh install from the Bell Labs .iso, just 
add the 9pcram.gz kernel as an option to your plan9.ini menu.
An optional tools.tgz and a working example PLAN9.INI is also provided.
<p>
ANTS is a modular toolkit. Many of the namespace modifying scripts, 
the hubfs shell multiplexer, and the rio variant "grio", do not depend on the kernel modifications.
The kernel modifications for bootup and for writable /proc/*/ns are independent from each other.
ANTS can be used as a self-sufficient micro-distribution of Plan 9 around 6mb in size.

<h2>Demonstration micro-cpu server VM image</h2>
You can check out how ANTS works in a VM image which includes only a small bootable 9fat partition. 
It was creaed with Qemu and intended for use in that vm 
although the .raw image may work in other vms also.
The 6mb download expands to a 50mb disk image which 
starts a working cpu server environment with local vga, rio,
cpu access, acme, and many other tools. It can tcp root to another root fs to function as
a standard cpu server if desired.

<p>
After bootup reaches the shell prompt, type "gui" to start rio on the local display. cpu (1) service
is also available on port 17060 as user glenda with default password "rootless". This image may be
a slightly older version of ANTS than the source code on this website.
