<h1><center>Advanced Namespace ToolS for Plan 9</center></h1>
<p>
The Giant ANTS for Plan 9 are a collection of software for making Plan 9 systems more
reliable and flexible by leveraging the power of namespaces.
<p>
The main component is a modified kernel which needs no root fs at boot and creates an
always available ram/paq rooted namespace accessible by cpu from which the user may launch
conventional namespaces.
<p>
ANTS is compatible with existing x86 Plan 9 installations. The ANTS kernel and tool modifies
startup and creates new capabilities, but does not change the standard user environment.
You can install the ANTS kernel and tools directly to a fresh install from the Bell Labs .iso, just 
add the 9pcram.gz kernel as an option to your plan9.ini menu with the additional variable
interactive=yes. An optional tools.tgz and a working example PLAN9.INI can also be installed.

<h2>Demonstration micro-cpu server VM image</h2>
You can check out how ANTS works in a VM image which includes only a small bootable
9fat partition. The 6mb image starts a working cpu server environment with local vga, rio,
cpu access, acme, and many other tools. It can tcp root to another root fs to function as
a standard cpu server if desired.
