You may either install the prebuilt 9pcram.gz and its optional tools.tgz, or build the kernel (and optional .tgz) locally. The file doc/stockplan9.ini is an example of a plan9.ini file which works with the rootless kernel in a stock plan9 fossil install. (Add the venti= if needed).

You may also build everything locally. The build script uses binds to work only within the rootless directory and leave all existing system src unmodified. It has the following modes:

build - with no arguments, this builds a 9pcram.gz kernel with the kernel and its compilation files located in compiletemp. 

build ramfs - this uses a ramfs for the compile and copies only the 9pcram.gz kernel to compiletemp.

build bootpaq - builds the bootpaq which is compiled into the kernel

build tools - this creates a tools.tgz using the list of tools in root/lib/_toolcopy

build patched - this compiles the slightly modified versions of rc and factotum adapted to the early namespace

build extras - this compiles hubfs and grio, screen-like hubs for persistent rcs and a modified rio to work in grid namespaces

build clean - this simply runs mk clean with the necessary binds to clear out the compiletemp folder

build everything - runs build clean build patched build tools build extras build bootpaq build

The 9pcram.gz kernel and optional .tgz are placed in the conventional 9fat partition. Conventional plan9.ini variiables are mostly supported, with many new optional additions. The most important are:

interactive=
if not provided, of if set to "traditional" the plan9rc scripts attempts to emulate the traditional bootprompts, while also executing any new options found from plan9.ini. Set interactive=yes to be prompted for all options throughout the boot process. Set interactive=no for automated bootup with no prompting unless an error condition is hit.

factotum=
rootstart=
these default to 'cpu' because the 9pcram kernel is compiled with that flag set. This means factotum will start in the same way as a cpu server and the /rc/bin/cpurc from any mounted root will be started. If you wish to produce terminal style behavior, set both of these to "terminal". It is also possible to run cpurc with terminal factotum or vice-versa, if you understand what you are doing and why.

tgzfs=
if you wish to load an optional tools.tgz or other named extra set of utilities into the bootup ramdisk, set this tools.tgz (or the name of your toolset.)

full explanation of all new plan9.ini possibilities and their defaults is found within the doc subdirectory.
