9front and Bell Labs are both supported.  Installing from source is
the recommended method, although precompiled kernels and tools.tgz may
be found in the "frontants" and "labsants" subdirectories on
files.9gridchan.org, along with source/utilities tarballs.

Overview: A full ANTS install includes a kernel (9ants for 9front,
9pcram.gz for Bell Labs) and tools.tgz placed in 9fat.  Hubfs, grio,
utility scripts, and manpages are installed to your main filesystem.
The 9fat plan9.ini needs a few additional variables for configuration.
The 9front /rc/bin/termrc needs one line added to the end.

Building and installing is mostly done by the build script in the root
of the ANTS directory.  This script has multiple modes.

9front Install
--------------

build 9front # compiles everything, but does not install anything. 
build fronthost # installs the userspace components
copy the new 9ants kernel and tools.tgz to the 9fat partition
edit plan9.ini
add the following line to /rc/bin/termrc:
home=/usr/$user; cd; . $home/lib/profile

The minimal change to plan9.ini is setting "bootfile=9ants"
To change to using the main ANTS boot script, add "bootcmd=plan9rc"
To set a password for remote access on systems not using an auth server:
add "privpassword=SOMEPASSWORD"

There are many optional plan9.ini variables which affect the plan9rc
script.  Please see its documentation for a comprehensive list.

Bell Labs Install
-----------------

build everything # compiles kernel, tools.tgz, and userspace utilities
build labshost # installs userspace components and docs
copy the 9pcram.gz and tools.tgz to 9fat and edit plan9.ini

build script info
-----------------

The build script uses binds to work only within the rootless directory
and leave all existing system src unmodified.  It has the following
modes:

9front build script modes
-------------------------

build - with no arguments, this builds a 9pcram.gz kernel with the
kernel and its compilation files located in compiletemp. Requires 
build extras build patched build bootpaq be run first.

build 9front - this builds a 9ants kernel and tools.tgz and copies
them to the root of the ants directory

build fronthost - builds and installs the userspace components
(hubfs, grio, contents of the scripts directory, manpages)

build 9frontinstall - installs kernel and tools to 9fat, then installs
userspace programs and prompts for a privpassword.  Requires "build
9front" be run first.  It is necessary to edit and change the new
plan9.ini as needed

build frontkernel - builds the 9ants kernel but does not create a
tools.tgz

build vultr - installs to a clean vultr install (hjfs recommended)

build vultrfossil - installs to a custom-partitioned 9front vultr install
changes system to use venti+fossil

build frontuninstall - uninstall installed userspace components.  does
not change 9fat

bell labs build script modes
----------------------------

build everything - runs build clean build patched build tools build
extras build bootpaq build

build labshost - this installs the userspace components

build ramfs - this uses a ramfs for the compile and copies only the
9pcram.gz kernel to compiletemp.

build bootpaq - builds the bootpaq which is compiled into the kernel

build tools - this creates a tools.tgz using the list of tools in
cfg/toolcopy

build patched - this compiles the slightly modified versions of rc and
factotum adapted to the early namespace

build extras - this compiles hubfs and grio, screen-like hubs for
persistent rcs and a modified rio to work in grid namespaces

build clean - this simply runs mk clean with the necessary binds to
clear out the compiletemp folder

build isoinstall - can be run after build everything to modify a Bell
Labs default install fresh from the .iso

Additional notes
----------------

set interactive= in plan9.ini to control bootup prompting. 
interactive=traditional (or unset) gives only standard boot prompts
interactive=yes gives fully interactive configurable boot
interactive=no will boot with no prompts unless info is missing

tgzfs= if you wish to load a tgz of tools other than tools.tgz, set
this to the name of the .tgz in 9fant, or set to "no" to skip loading

fatpath= if the correct 9fat partition isn't auto-detected, set this
to supply the correct pathname

full explanation of all new plan9.ini possibilities and their defaults
is found within the doc subdirectory.
