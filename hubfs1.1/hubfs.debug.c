 * As requests come in, we add them to the queue, then fill queued requests that are waiting.
 * The data buffers are statically sized at creation. This means that data is continuously read
 * and written in a "rotating" pattern. When we reach the end, we wrap back around to the beginning. 
 * Our job is accurately transferring the bytes in and out of the bucket and

/* basic 9pfile implementation taken from /sys/src/lib9p/ramfs.c */

/* A note on paranoid mode and writer/reader synchronization.  The
default behavior is "broadcast like" rather than pipelike, because
writers are never blocked by default.  This is because in a network
situation with remote readers, blocking writes to wait for remote
client reads to complete produces an unpleasant user experience where
the remote latency limits the local environment.  As a consequence, by
default it is up to the writer to a file to limit the quantity and
speed of data writen to what clients are able receive.  The normal
intended mode of operation is for shells, and in this case data is
both 'bursty' and usually fairly small.  */

/* Paranoid mode is intended as "safe mode" and changes this
first-come first served behavior.  In paranoid mode, the readers and
writers attempt to synchronize.  The hub ketchup and tomatoflag
variables are used to monitor if readers have 'fallen behind' the
current data pointer, and if so, the writer is qlocked and sleeps
while we fork off a new flow of control.  We need to do more than just
answer the queued reads - because we are inside the 9p library (we are
the functions called by its srv pointer) we want the 9p library to
actually answer the incoming reads so we have read messages queued to
answer.  Just clearing out the read message queue isn't enough to
prioritize readers - we need to fork off so the controlling 9p library
has a chance to answer NEW reads.  By forking and sleeping the writer,
we allow the os to answer a new read request, which will unlock the
writer, which then needs to die at the end of its function because we
are a single-threaded 9p server and need to maintain one master flow
of control.  */

/* The paranoid/safe mode code is still limited in its logic for
handling multiple readers.  The ketchup and tomatoflag are per hub,
and a hub can have multiple clients.  It is intentional that these
multiple clients will 'race for the flag' and the writer will stop
waiting when one reader catches up enough to set ketchup and tomato
flag.  A more comprehensive solution would require adding new
structure to the client mq and a ref-counting implementation for
attaches to the hub so the hub could check the status of each client
individually.  There are additional problems with this because clients
are free to 'stop reading' at any time and thus a single client
unattaching will end up forcing the hub into 'as slow as possible'
mode.  */

/* To avoid completely freezing a hub, there is still a default "go
ahead" time even when clients have not caught up.  This time is
difficult to assess literally because it is a repeated sleep loop so
the os may perform many activities during the sleep.  Extending the
length of this delay time increases the safety guarantee for lagging
clients, but also increases the potential for lag and for
molasses-like shells after remote clients disconnect.  */

/* In general for the standard use of interactive shells paranoid mode
is unnecessary and all of this can and should be ignored.  For data
critical applications aiming for high speed constant throughput,
paranoid mode can and should be used, but additional data
verification, such as a cryptographic hashing protocol, would still be
recommended.  */
