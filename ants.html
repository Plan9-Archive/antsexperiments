<h1><center>Advanced Namespace Tools for Plan 9</center></h1>
<p>
The Giant ANTS for Plan 9 are a collection of software for making Plan
9 systems more flexible and reliable by leveraging the power of
namespaces.
<p>
The main component is a modified kernel which needs no root fs at
boot.  It creates an always available ram/paq rooted namespace
accessible by cpu(1) from which the user may launch conventional
namespaces.  Additional tools allow the user to reroot quickly to
different namespaces and create hubs of persistent rc shells shared
between all machines on a grid.
<p>
ANTS is compatible with existing x86 Plan 9 installations.  The ANTS
kernel and tools modify startup and create new capabilities, but do
not change the standard user environment.  You can install the ANTS
kernel and tools directly to a fresh install from the 9front or Bell
Labs .iso, just add the 9ants or 9pcram.gz kernel and optional
tools.tgz to your 9fat partition and edit plan9.ini as needed.  Full
install/use documentation is also provided.
<p>
ANTS is a modular toolkit.  Many of the namespace modifying scripts,
the hubfs shell multiplexer, and the rio variant "grio", do not depend
on the kernel modifications.  The kernel modifications for bootup and
for writable /proc/*/ns are independent from each other.  ANTS can be
used as a self-sufficient micro-distribution of Plan 9 around 6mb in
size.

<h2>Demonstration micro-cpu server VM image</h2>
You can check out how ANTS works in a VM image which includes only a
small bootable 9fat partition.  It was creaed with Qemu and intended
for use in that vm although the .raw image may work in other vms also.
The 6mb download expands to a 16mb disk image which starts a working
cpu server environment with local vga, rio, cpu access, acme, and many
other tools.  It can tcp root to another root fs to function as a
standard cpu server if desired.

<p>
After bootup reaches the shell prompt, type "gui" to start rio on the
local display.  cpu (1) service is also available on port 17060 as
user glenda with default password "rootless".  If a cdrom is attached,
the cd bootup option will use the cd termrc as well as providing an
independent namespace available via cpu.
