from the base ants directory:

build 9front ## makes a 9ants kernel in root of ants directories

build 9frontinstall ## installs and modifies the system

install designed for use on fresh install from .iso to a qemu vm,
please examine and modify before using on your local system

at startup enter bootfile=9ants then type boot, use 9pcf if the new
kernel fails

use bootcmd=plan9rc for configurable bootup as described in the
documentation otherwise the standard bootrc script + a default ants
namespace runs

listens on port 17060 with password rootless by default change
privpassword= in plan9.ini to change password, leave blank for none

enter 9front userland from cpu/drawterm in to port 17060: open a
window and

rerootwin -f boot 

service=con 

. $home/lib/profile 

grio

note for terminal users: it is important to modify the termrc file to
include this series of commands:

home=/usr/$user; cd; . $home/lib/profile

this is necessary to make sure the user on the terminal stays in the
namespace created by the termrc on top of the ants service namespace
accessible via cpu or through the hubfs,
