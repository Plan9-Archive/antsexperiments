ANTS has a custom kernel and userspace software. A full install
includes the 9ants kernel, an optional tools.tgz in 9fat, and the
userspace components. 

from the base ants directory:

build 9front ## makes a 9ants kernel in root of ants directories

build portsinstall ## install userspace components without kernel

At this point the user can copy the 9ants kernel to 9fat and modify
the plan9.ini file as needed. ANTS has several additional boot options.

build 9frontinstall ## converts a new stock installation to ANTS

9frontinstall designed for use on fresh install from .iso to a qemu vm,
using standard defaults, please examine and adapt for local system

at startup enter bootfile=9ants then type boot, use 9pcf if the new
kernel fails

use bootcmd=plan9rc for configurable bootup as described in the
documentation otherwise the standard bootrc script + a default ants
namespace runs

listens on port 17060 for cpu connections by default, add
privpassword=YOURPASS in plan9.ini to set password

enter 9front userland from cpu/drawterm in to port 17060: open a
window and

rerootwin -f boot 

service=con 

. $home/lib/profile 

grio

note for terminal users: it is important to modify the termrc file to
include this series of commands:

home=/usr/$user; cd; . $home/lib/profile

this is necessary to make sure the user on the terminal stays in the
namespace created by the termrc on top of the ants service namespace
accessible via cpu or through the hubfs,
