plan9rc is the script run after boot(8). It supports several new options in plan9.ini. "interactive=yes" changes the boot process to an interactive question-and-response format where all variables can be changed from their defaults and the possibility of dropping to a shell is available. "ramsetup=" provides the name of a command to set up an initial skeleton filesystem on a ramdisk. The default is the provided ramskel script compiled into the kernel /boot, which expands /boot/skel.tar. If "tgzfs=tools.tgz" then an additional root filesystem of this name will be expanded from the 9fat partition. "factotum=" specifies either cpu, terminal, or user parameters to start factotum. "rootstart=" specifies either cpu, terminal, other or none parameters as the final system startup script. These default to the setting in /env/service.

traditional=yes is an experimental variable which aims for as complete an emulation of the original bootup process as feasible.

There are tools provided to use the interactive startup as autoconfiguration. run savecfg to store a copy of the curent config in /tmp/p9cfg which can be pasted into plan9.ini as a menuitem.

full list of variables:
bootparse is a copy of bootargs as described by boot(8) and plan9.ini(8), not set as separate var
factotum - type of factotum [cpu terminal debug]
sysname - standard sysname from plan9.ini
ramsetup - program to set up ramfs for bootscripts, defaults to ramskel
startventi - set to yes to start the venti server [yes]
getrootfs - determined from bootparse or set by user during interactive [tcp local]
fs - standard fs address from plan9.ini, needed for tcp booting
auth - standard auth address for tcp booting
venti - standard venti address variable from plan9.ini
fossil - standard fossil address from plan9.ini not parsed fully correctly in general
cfs - standard cfs address from plan9.ini
initscript - script forked off into namespace provided initskel begins cpu server on 17020
namespace - namespace for starting initscript
rootstart - whether or not to start cpurc or termrc scripts from mounted root [cpu terminal]
staylocal - whether to stay within the namespace of the plan9rc script on the console, only option is [yes]
afterfact - command to execute after starting factotum (happens before everything else)
afterroot - command to execute after mounting rootfs but before initscript or cpu or termrc

options for ramskel and initksel can also be set in plan9.ini

tgzfs= specifies a compressed fs to retrive from 9fat for extra files. set to tools.tgz to use the provided example
binddevs=no turns off binding off default kernel devices
setfactotum=no turns off putting a default password into bootes factotum
netsvc=no turns off ipconfig
hubcpu=no turns off hubfs and cpu listener
cpuport=number of port for cpu to listen on
