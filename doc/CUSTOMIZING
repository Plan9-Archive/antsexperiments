There are two main methods of customizing the install.  One is to
rebuild the kernel with a different selection of tools compiled into
boot.  This is done by editing the file frontmods/boot/bootfs.proto to
controls the tools compiled into the bootpaq.  The other method is
customizing the optional tools.tgz.  A premade script for creating it
is included at cfg/_toolcopy and the command build tools uses
that script to control what binaries and scripts will be added to the
/bin of the tools.tgz You can customize the initial ultra-minimal
skelton fs by working within bootdir.extras/root.  Be cautious in
modifying this or the plan9rc script may fail in unexpected ways or
the early boot environment may break.
