## Working on 9front's new TLS boot option

Plan 9 has always had an option for "tcp boot" - which means attaching to a root fileserver over the network at startup. 9front has recently added a "tls boot" option, which is similar, but sets up an encrypted connection using TLS. I'd like to get this working and supported in ANTS.

I have made a first attempt at adding support for it in the plan9rc bootup script, but haven't succeeded in making it work yet. However, I haven't succeeded with the standard bootrc script either, so I think I may have an auth configuration issue in my systems, seperate from anything the plan9rc script is doing. On the client system I see an error like:

	mount: mount /root: tls error

And on the server side I see this error:

	/bin/aux/trampoline: dial net!$fs!9fs: cs: can't translate address: dns: resource does not exist; negrcode

The server error looks familiar, from other authentication issues. Perhaps some information is missing from /lib/ndb/local. Looking at the /rc/bin/service/tcp17020 file, it seems like I might need to be running standard 9fs on port 564, and the port 17020 service will just wrap it in a tls tunnel.

So, I have now started standard fs listener on port 564 from fossil, and added fs= and auth= to the server ndb. After doing this, I was able to successfully use srvtls as a test from my client node, so I am optimistic that the boot might work. About to retest...and...success!
