It is time to begin the process of updating ANTS to the latest version of 9front. This is an aspect of the development process that should be re-engineered. As changes occur in 9front, compilation errors develop in ANTS' patched versions of the Plan 9 kernel and software. There are two issues: one, fixing the breakage caused by changes in the underlying 9front system, and two, having the build process understand the synchronization between ANTS-versions and 9front-versions. The build script in general has a large amount of technical debt.
