## Writing a better README and basic install/use docs

I have written a lot of documentation for ANTS (probably too much) but the old README and other files in the base directory are just not good enough. I'm going to start ground-up rewrites beginning with the README.

### README

## Advanced Namespace Tools for 9front and Bell Labs Plan 9

This is a toolkit of additions and modifications to Plan 9. It is designed to make Plan 9 installations, on single machines or on networks, more flexible. ANTS has:

* A modified boot process which creates an isolated administrative namespace independent of any root fileserver.
* A modified kernel which accepts manipulation of process namespace via writes of standard namespace operations to the /proc/PID/ns files
* Scripts for moving between and systematically altering namespaces such as "rerootwin" which is similar to chroot in unix and keeps the terminal devices at /mnt/term active.
* Optional fossil/venti support with administrative scripts for progressive backup/replication and maintaining a log of rootscores
* Hubfs 9p fs for networked persistent shell sessions and a lightweight general purpose multiclient read/write buffered message queue with pipelike hubfiles
* Grio modified Rio with customizable appearance for color-coded namespace grouping, user-selectable additional menu command, and hubfs integration

Most of these components are synergistic, but not interdependent. The userspace programs and utilities do not generally depend on using the modified ANTS kernel.

## Installing on 9front from source

Check that your 9front hg revision matched up with a compatible ANTS revision. The most recent tested 9front revision is 5641, the "GZ" release. Previously tested ANTS/9front revisions are listed in the INSTALLING file.The build script has a variety of possible targets. A basic sequence:

	# compile everything but installs nothing
	build 9front
	# install userspace components but not kernel/9fat
	build fronthost 
	# copy new kernel and tools to 9fat partition
	9fs 9fat && cp 9ants /n/9fat/9ants && cp tools.tgz /n/9fat/tools.tgz
	# edit plan9.ini
	acme /n/9fat/plan9.ini

To allow you to select between kernels at boot, you can set bootfile= in plan9.ini to not provide a value. Then at boot you will have to type "bootfile=9ants" or "bootfile=9pcf" (assuming that is your original kernel name) and then "boot". You will probably want to set tgzfs=tools.tgz and cpuport=17060 and possibly bootcmd=plan9rc. frontmods/plan9.ini has a minimal example that works with a fresh install to a qemu vm, for instance.
