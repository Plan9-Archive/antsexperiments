# Guide to the tutorials
## What you need

The absolute minimum is a copy of qemu and the 6mb
[9worker](http://9gridchan.org/9worker.gz) image.  Drawterm is also
required for almost all of the tutorials.  It is also good to have
copies of the Bell Labs and/or 9front cd .iso images.  The more
advanced tutorials make use of a fully installed and modified image
that can be setup after an install from the bell labs iso, so you need
about two gigs of hdd space to make a full image if you wish to follow
those tutorials.  A copy of the fully installed 9queen can be
downloaded from
