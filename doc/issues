When trying to secure the service namespace against failures of the main environment, the mount of cs in the default /lib/namespace file is problematic. Even when using factotum -x, new processes started by cpu and import will try to mount /srv/cs and freeze. The /lib/namespace file used by the early environment is stored in ramdisk so removing the mount of cs (and dns?) will prevent frozen logins via cpu.

the -m parameter is not passed to hjfs when plan9rc is the boot script

the partition and filesystem detection logic in plan9rc should be improved

there is a namespace/file conflict between /lib of the 9front bootfs and /lib from the ramfs skeleton. trying to run cs in the early 9front environment will complain that /lib/ndb/local does not exist.

ventiprog should be more careful about not replacing the wrcmd with bad information

hubshell should probably make %remote shells do rfork n to isolate their namespace

when controlling linux machines via hubfs, it is necessary to use bash if you wish to use interactive tools like ed. using rc results in input being processed by the rc running underneath ed. why?

should add autosnapshotting to vultr fossil config

The u9fs in the bell labs distribution needs two minor patches to build correctly. First is taken from https://code.google.com/p/plan9front/source/diff?spec=svn4be476d6a993298bb5a797a6f872212536c69541&r=4be476d6a993298bb5a797a6f872212536c69541&format=side&path=/sys/src/cmd/unix/u9fs/plan9.h&old_path=/sys/src/cmd/unix/u9fs/plan9.h&old=eaccc3e8d22668badfdfd7fa12c67f3fbb94c67d

in file u9fs/plan9.h in the enum around line 100 specifying 

	Runemax		= 0xFFFF,	/* 16 bit rune */

is one, and the other is adding in u9fs/rune.c in the obvious spot at the top enum

	Bit5 =2;


How exactly does inferno achieve equivalent functionality to plan 9 /srv? chan seems the same but different...

why does it work to communicate with venti on loopback through an import of /net for writes, but some reads are unreliable? (cant fortune)

similarly, why are some binaries non-executable via vacfs? (both seem to be related to short reads, client not requesting more data?)

what is needed to get any ssh client other than openssh working?
