When trying to secure the service namespace against failures of the main environment, the mount of cs in the default /lib/namespace file is problematic. Even when using factotum -x, new processes started by cpu and import will try to mount /srv/cs and freeze. The /lib/namespace file used by the early environment is stored in ramdisk so removing the mount of cs (and dns?) will prevent frozen logins via cpu.

the -m parameter is not passed to hjfs when plan9rc is the boot script

the partition and filesystem detection logic in plan9rc should be improved

there is a namespace/file conflict between /lib of the 9front bootfs and /lib from the ramfs skeleton. trying to run cs in the early 9front environment will complain that /lib/ndb/local does not exist.

ventiprog should be more careful about not replacing the wrcmd with bad information

hubshell should probably make %remote shells do rfork n to isolate their namespace

when controlling linux machines via hubfs, it is necessary to use bash if you wish to use interactive tools like ed. using rc results in input being processed by the rc running underneath ed. why?

------ non-ants specific random questions ------

How exactly does inferno achieve equivalent functionality to plan 9 /srv? chan seems the same but different...

why does it work to communicate with venti on loopback through an import of /net for writes, but some reads are unreliable? (cant fortune)

similarly, why are some binaries non-executable via vacfs? (both seem to be related to short reads, client not requesting more data?)

what is needed to get any ssh client other than openssh working?
