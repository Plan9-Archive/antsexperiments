The initskel script is the equivalent of a small cpurc file for the rootless environment. By default it binds additional devices, starts mtgen, issues ipconfig if hasn't been done earlier, and begins a cpu listener on a non-standard port and puts a persistent rc in a hubfs. The persistent rc can be used to 'tunnel down' to the rootless environment from a different namespace. 

Most of the variables are configured to have a default behavior which is deactivated by setting =no in plan9.ini or answering no during interactive startup. Some of the defaults are passive, some are active - in other words, =no turns on some behaviors as described as follows:

binddevs=no prevents the binding of the standard kernel devices ( f t m v L P u U '$' Σ κ )
hostfactotum=no adds a new key to factotum set to "rootless" for dom "noroot.com"

netsvc=no turns off ipconfig although it may have been activated earlier by plan9rc

cpusvc=no turns off the cpu listener

hubsvc=no turns off the hubfs. 

cpuport= sets the listening port. the default is 17020 so it is necessary to use a full dialstring to connect ( cpu -h tcp!address!17020)

Two more variables are not prompted for and must be set in the environment (usually in plan9.ini)

justipconfig=no activates cs and dns in addition to ipconfig

staysane=no activates un-authenticated export of the root fs to the whole world

ordinary=no starts an auth server if you have provided a keyfs file in 9fat and compiled in the auth and keyfs programs.
