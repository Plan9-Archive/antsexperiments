There are two main methods of customizing the install. One is to rebuild the kernel with a different selection of tools compiled into boot. This is done mostly by editing the file root/lib/_mkpaq which controls the tools compiled into the bootpaq.
The other method is customizing the optional tools.tgz. A premade script for creating it is included at root/lib/_toolcopy and the command build tools uses that script to control what binaries and scripts will be added to the /bin of the tools.tgz
You can customize the initial ultra-minimal skelton fs by working within bootdir.extras/root. Be cautious in modifying this or the plan9rc script may fail in unexpected ways or the early boot environment may break.

It is also beneficial if some of the ANTS software is also present in the main hosted environments. rerootwin and the namespace scripts, /lib/namespace.saveterm, and hubfs hubshell hub and grio can all be installed to the main environment without disrupting it.
