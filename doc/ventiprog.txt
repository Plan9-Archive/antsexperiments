     DESCRIPTION
          These commands aid in the maintenance and replication of
          venti/fossil servers. See fossil(4) and fossilcons(8) for an
          overview of the fossil system, fossil/last, flfmt -v, and
          venti(8) and venti-backup(8) for an overview of venti and
          replication with wrarena.

          Note that these commands make certain assumptions about sys-
          tem configuration and require some manual setup and addi-
          tional administrative actions for use as a complete
          backup/replication workflow.  As with all system administra-
          tion scripts, please study their interaction with your local
          environment before use.

        Overview
          These scripts help perform the workflow of replicating
          between active ventis, replicating fossils that make use of
          them, and preserving the fossil rootscores. There is a set
          sequence of operations to correctly replicate active
          venti/fossil systems. First, and not automated by these
          scripts, an active fossil(4) must be taking snapshots. This
          happens automatically, or can be triggered by sending the
          comand fsys main snap -a to the fossil console. The workflow
          of ventiprog and related commands assumes that the desired
          snapshot operation has been completed.

        Venti replication
          After the desired snapshot is finished (which may simply be










     VENTIPROG(8)                                         VENTIPROG(8)



          the automatic daily snapshot) the fossilize of a given
          partition prints the output of fossil/last , mounts a 9fat
          partition if necessary, and appends the rootscore to
          /n/9fat/rootscor which is taken as a conventional storage
          location for fossil rootscores and venti offset data.
          Rootscores need to be kept secure so this file should be
          treated in the same manner as nvram.

          After a snapshot has been completed and the rootscore saved,
          replicating data from the venti used by that fossil to other
          ventis will make that rootscore available for use. The task
          of progressively replicating data between ventis is given to
          the ventiprog script which takes an optional list of
          targetventis to direct the data replication. Prior to using
          ventiprog , the user must create the file /n/9fat/wrcmd
          which contains a venti/wrarena command with the correct
          arena offset. As described by venti-backup(8) this command
          will take a form such as: "wrarena -h
          tcp!ip.of.venti.server!17034 -o 537665536 /dev/sdC0/arenas
          0x0" to begin. The first parameter to -o is calculated by
          subtracting 8192 from the location of venti partition as
          retrieved from the /index file of the venti http server.
          Each time ventiprog is run it updates this command with a
          new final clump offset parameter. It is the user's responsi-
          bility to note when a venti arenas partition is filled and
          adjust the -o parameter and reset the final parameter to
          0x0.

        Fossil replication
          Resetting running fossils to a different score and replicat-
          ing fossils between systems is done with fosreset , which
          uses vacscore to flfmt-v the given partition using the
          ventiaddr given. If no parameter is provided the environment
          value of $venti will be used and if a partition is absent
          /dev/sdC0/fossil will be used as a default. The script first
          uses the simplified fossil-only foshalt script to sync and
          halt the fossil, then kills all running fossil processes
          before issuing the flfmt-v command.

          cpsys automates replicating between the fossil of source
          system and that of dest system. IMPORTANT: this script
          assumes that the partition identification is the same on
          both systems. It also requires the rexexec(8) service to be
          listening on both source and destination machines. It issues
          the fossilize command to source and saves the output to cre-
          ate the parameters for a fosreset command sent to dest.

          Because running fossils are halted by the actions of
          fosreset and cpsys , the fossilstart script assists in
          restating the fossil located on a given partition using
          standard default parameters. If srvname is given, it will be
          used as a stem for the fossil file and also its

     EXAMPLE
          These commands are issued from the service namespace of a
          venti(8) server.

               % rx fileserver echo fsys main snap -a '>>/srv/fscons'
               # begin a snap and then wait for it to complete

               % rx fileserver fossilize >>/n/9fat/rootscor
               # saves the rootscore both on the file and venti server

               % ventiprog $ventis
               # assumes the user has a variable in the environment like
               # ventis=(ip.addr.one ip.addr.two ip.addr.three)

               % cp /n/9fat/rootscor /n/remote/backup
               # copy the rootscores to the backup venti hosts

               % cpsys fileserver backupserver
               # reset the backup fossil to the rootscore of the snapshot

          After this seequence, the backup server can choose to use
          one of the ventis which also contains the replicated
          rootscore. Usually this is done by changing the value of the
          $venti variable in plan9.ini(8)

     BUGS
          ventiprog should automate the construction of the wrcmd from
          the venti http/index file.
