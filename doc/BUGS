edit stockplan9.ini to remind user of venti=#S possibility from stock install?
improve intelligence of venti dialing? add tcp and 17034 to raw ips? - maybe not, possibility of local #S venti complicates trying to screw with the venti variable.

FIXED bug in default plan9.ini correlated with local! parsing broken for local!/dev
FIXED only 2 known bugs, reuploading feb 4 beta version 0.9988
FXIED fossilconf doesnt work, it wants comp and aux/zerotrunc - edited the scripts a bit
FIXED the issue of bin subdirs is pretty stupid, with bootpaq and ramfs maybe this can be rethought - changed namespace binds to work around
FIXED wrong perms for ventiprog script
