edit stockplan9.ini to remind user of venti=#S possibility from stock install?
fossilconf doesnt work, it wants comp and aux/zerotrunc
the issue of bin subdirs is pretty stupid, with bootpaq and ramfs maybe this can be rethought
improve intelligence of venti dialing? add tcp and 17034 to raw ips? - maybe not, possibility of local #S venti complicates trying to screw with the venti variable.
FIXED wrong perms for ventiprog script - NOT PUSHED yet to sources
