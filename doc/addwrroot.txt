     NAME
          addwrroot, addroroot, importwrroot, importroroot, addsources
          - mount and bind new fileservers for use

     SYNOPSIS
          addwrroot targetroot
          addroroot targetroot
          importwrroot targetroot
          importroroot targetroot
          addsources

     DESCRIPTION
          These commands dial and mount a given filesystem taking
          targetroot as a system name or IP to be dialed. The "add"
          scripts will check first for /srv/targetroot before making
          use of the network. After attaching to the fs a series of
          bind(1) commands is performed to make use of the target's
          binaries, library files, and $home if available.

          The "add" versions of the scripts dial port 564 for standard
          9p file service after checking /srv. The "import" versions
          of the scripts dial port 17007 for import(4) from cpu
          servers.  The "wr" versions of the scripts are for servers
          which you have write permission.  The "ro" versions assume
          you are not allowed to write to the target.

          The addsources script takes no arguments, it dials the Bell
          Labs "sources" server and binds its binaries and library.
          This is intended as a way to briefly work with binaries or
          other files from the distribution over the network in a
          pinch.  Please do not make sources your main fileserver with
          this method.

     BUGS
          No sanity checks are performed to verify that the requested
          binds make sense. If the scripts are mis-targeted the names-
          pace of the invoking shell may become unusable.
