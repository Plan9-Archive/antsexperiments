deal with lib/ndb head on. probably write configurator script? or just document
test cpns under load and stress of weird stuff thrown at it - probably deferred, too much other stuff
make rerootwin robust and sane - improved now, net.alt is still probably wrong! added sanity options for placement
improve namespace acquisition tools like addwrroot - more consistent and tested now! seemingly robust
test multiple factotums for different users with different keys! isolated factotums tested with different keys, note to control auth targeting and namespaces
fully automate build process and make it portable, including choosing boot and rootfs.tgz contents - made portable
check on other boot methods and formats to support in plan9rc - look at /sys/src/9/9pcfs
improve documentation and write tutorials and possibly scripted demos? - in progress - in progress 
investigate compatibility with 9front - in progress
!create spawnenv script for launching self-sufficient quasivirtual namespaces - plan9rc and initskel are evolving in this direction
!write configurator/installer for different system roles - replaced with saving interactive config
!upload to sources - done with hg!
!comprehensive set of plan9.ini examples  - done
