namespace scripts

addwrroot TARGET attaches to a writable server from /srv/TARGET or via srv TARGET and then binds the namespace to make use of the bin and /usr/$user directories and the font library.

importwrroot TARGET uses import to attach and also binds in the target's /srv.

These commands also have variants addroroot and importroroot to bring in read-only servers.

addsources dials sources and binds to its binaries and lib
