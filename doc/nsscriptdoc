namespace scripts

cpns MODELpid TARGETpid -t -r -x [pattern] -o [pattern]
addns MODELpid TARGETpid -t -r -x [pattern] -o [pattern]
subns MODELpid TARGETpid -t -r -x [pattern] -o [pattern]

These scripts perform namespace modifications on processes via /proc/$pid/ns using the writable ns mod. cpns attempts to make TARGET a copy of MODEL. addns adds to TARGET binds and mounts found in MODEL but not TARGET, and subns removes from TARGET binds and mounts not present in MODEL. Please note that these scripts work by simple "lines in common" and do not understand the graph structure and dependencies of a namespace structure. The options are any combination of:

-t test only, print commands to standard output
-r riosafe, avoid operations involving /mnt/wsys /mnt/term /dev/cons and rio
-x exclude [pattern] from namespace operations
-o only operations matching [pattern] will be issued

addwrroot TARGET attaches to a writable server from /srv/TARGET or via srv TARGET and then binds the namespace to make use of the bin and /usr/$user directories and the font library.

importwrroot TARGET uses import to attach and also binds in the target's /srv.

These commands also have variants addroroot and importroroot to bring in read-only servers.

addsources dials sources and binds to its binaries and lib

rerootwin TARGET is used to allow processes running in rio on remote machines via drawterm or cpu to "reroot" themselves without losing use of the mouse and keyboard. This script is very useful for allowing free use of other namespaces from within a 'rootless' service environment.
