Update July 2015<p>
I have prepared a new version of ANTS which is compatible with Bell Labs sources as of July 2015. It also includes 9front support.

dfb1cdb9aacad93467caf21f8004c87d9d119cd4  ants2015.tgz
<p>
The old images still work but have not been updated. There are currently no 9p or venti services available, but I am hoping to bring plan 9 public services back online at some point.
<p>
----------------------------------------------------
<p>
The Advanced Namespace ToolS are now available for Plan 9 From Bell Labs. 
<!---
The website <a href="http://ants.9gridchan.org">ants.9gridchan.org</a> has a current copy of the tools, 
compiled kernel for x86 and tools.tgz. 
It is also available via ftp <a href="ftp://ants.9gridchan.org">here</a> 
and also via 9p or venti. 9fs ants.9gridchan.org and cd /n/ants.9gridchan.org/rootlessnext 
or vacfs or unvac the following vac score from venti.9gridchan.org:

Here is <a href="9worker.gz">6mb gzip of a 16mb .raw hdd image</a> ready for qemu with rio gui, acme, and cpu server access on port 17060 password: rootless, and many more tools.

Tutorial walkthroughs of how to use 9worker and how to create a 9queen and use the two together can be found at
<a href="http://antfarm.9gridchan.org/tutorial">The ANTS Farm</a>
<p>
[The tutorials are somewhat out of date with regards to current network resources and distribution versions]
<p>
A fully installed Plan 9 image with all the ANTS tools ready for use in the tutorials is also available. It is a 132 mb download and the .raw image is sized to 2 gigabytes. Here is the <a href="http://sphericalharmony.com/plan9/9queen.gz">9queen.gz</a> image.

Here is a <a href="http://www.9gridchan.org/9grid_node_img">link to the old site</a>, which is now semi-deprecated. There is no longer a public registry, venti, or cpu server. The preinstalled images and associated tools should still work but I'm working on newer projects, so I'm no longer updating and bugfixing them. Check my contrib dir on sources (sources/contrib/mycroftiv) for current software.
