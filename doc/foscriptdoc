The scripts foshalt, fossilize, fosreset, fossilstart are used to aid in preserving fossil root scores and resetting fossils to known states. foshalt is simply an equivalent to fshalt. fossilize retrieves the fossil/last information from the given fossil (default /dev/sdC0/fossil if unspecified) and stores the rootscore, fossil location, and venti variable appended to the file /n/9fat/rootscor. It also outputs this information in the form of parameters to the utility to be run on the TARGET fossil's machine. fosreset score [fossil] [venti] formats a fossil to the given rootscore. 

Fossilize may be run on a running fossil to preserve its last snapshot. To make the rootscore current, issue 'fsys main snap -a' to the console and allow that command to complete prior to fossilizing the root score.
