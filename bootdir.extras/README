Files in this directory are part of the early ANTS boot sequence to
create a usable namespace not rooted from the main fileserver.
plan9rc controls bootup, ramskel makes a usable root fs skeleton in
ram, initskel starts a minimal cpu-server like environment in the
early namespace, and the namespace files in combination with rerootwin
allow the user to move from the service namespace into others while
maintaining connection to the GUI.
