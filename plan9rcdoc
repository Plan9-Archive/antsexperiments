plan9rc is the script run after boot(8). It supports several new options in plan9.ini. "interactive=yes" changes the boot process to an interactive question-and-response format where all variables can be changed from their defaults and the possibility of dropping to a shell is available. "ramsetup=" provides the name of a command to set up an initial skeleton filesystem on a ramdisk. The default is the provided ramskel script compiled into the kernel /boot, which expands /boot/skel.tar. If "getrootfs=rootfs.tgz" then an additional root filesystem of this name will be expanded from the 9fat partition. "factotum=" specifies either cpu, terminal, or user parameters to start factotum. "rootstart=" specifies either cpu, terminal, other or none parameters as the final system startup script. These default to the setting in /env/service.
